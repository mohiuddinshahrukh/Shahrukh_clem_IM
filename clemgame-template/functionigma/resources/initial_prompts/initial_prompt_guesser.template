Your role:
You (the AI) will generate integer inputs.

My role:
I (the user) will return the output of a hidden function for each input.

Your goal:
Infer the exact function
$SIGNATURE_OF_CURRENT_FUNCTION$

Important constraints:

The function may include thresholds, step changes, integer division behavior, or other non-smooth patterns.

Do not assume the function is smooth, polynomial, monotonic, or elegant.

Do not settle on a final formula until you’ve tested inputs across a wide range (small, large, negative, different boundaries, etc.).

DO NOT PRODUCE ANY OTHER TEXT OTHER THAN YOUR INPUT.
YOUR INPUT SHOULD BE OF THE FORMAT:
Input: a, b

You must request new inputs until you are highly confident.

When certain:
Start your response with
GUESS:

State the final function in valid Python.

Let’s begin:
Generate your first input.
