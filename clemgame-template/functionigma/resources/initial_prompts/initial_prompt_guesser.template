Your role:
You (the AI) will propose inputs for a hidden function so you can infer it.

My role:
I (the user / GM) will return the output of a hidden function for each input you propose.

Goal:
Infer the exact function:
$SIGNATURE_OF_CURRENT_FUNCTION$

Context:
Category: $CATEGORY$.
This function takes $NUM_PARAMS$ parameter(s) with names and types:
$PARAM_LIST$
(Format shown below.)

Important rules:
- You MUST provide inputs matching the declared parameter types.
  - For integers/floats: provide numeric literals (e.g. `-5`, `3.14`).
  - For strings: provide quoted strings (single or double quotes), e.g. `'hello'` or "hello".
  - For booleans: use `True` or `False`.
- Output values returned by the GM will be of the function's return type.
- Do not assume smoothness, monotonicity, etc. Test widely for edge cases.

Protocol:
- Until you are certain, produce exactly one line **and nothing else**:
  `Input: v1, v2, v3, ...`
  where each vi has the exact type required (strings must be quoted).
- When certain, start your response with `GUESS:` followed by:
  1) The full guessed function as valid Python inside a triple-backtick fenced block labeled `python`.
  2) A short explanation of how you derived it.

Examples:
- For a one-arg string function:
  `Input: 'hello'`
- For a two-arg int function:
  `Input: 3, -7`

Formatting rules (strict):
- Commas between arguments.
- Strings must be quoted.
- No extra text, no explanation lines.
- If you violate the format, you will be prompted to resend.

Begin. Generate your first input.
